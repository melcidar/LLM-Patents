A door structure of a motor vehicle having an inner panel and an outer panel, comprising: a first impact load absorber member, provided within a space defined by the inner panel and the outer panel, for absorbing and reducing a side collision impact load acting on a passenger during a side collision; a trim member provided at a passenger compartment side of the inner panel; a second impact load absorber member, provided between the inner panel and the trim member, for absorbing and reducing the side collision impact load; and opening means, provided in the inner panel so as to correspond to a location of the second impact load absorber member, for allowing at least one portion of said first impact load absorber member to move toward a passenger compartment of the vehicle from the space and contact with the second impact load absorber member during the side collision."
US5865496,5865496,"33. A door structure of a motor vehicle having an inner panel and an outer panel, comprising: a first impact load absorber member, provided within a space defined by the inner panel and the outer panel and spaced from the outer panel, for absorbing and reducing a side collision impact load acting on a passenger during a side collision; an impact bar extending in the space defined by the inner panel and the outer panel for supporting the first impact load absorber member; a trim member provided at a passenger compartment side of the inner panel; and a second impact load absorber member, provided through a space between the inner panel and the trim member and spaced from the inner panel, for absorbing and reducing the side collision impact load; wherein said side collision impact load is absorbed and reduced in steps by a first contact of the outer panel and the first impact load absorber member, a second contact of the first impact load absorber member and the inner panel and a third contact of the inner panel and the second impact load absorber member during the side collision."
US5865496,5865496,"1. A door structure of a motor vehicle having an inner panel and an outer panel comprising: an impact load absorber member, provided within a space defined by the inner panel and the outer panel, for absorbing and reducing a side collision impact load acting on a passenger during a side collision; opening means, provided in the inner panel, for allowing at least one portion of said impact load absorber member to move toward a passenger compartment of the vehicle from the space by the side collision impact load; supporting means provided in the door, for supporting said impact load absorber member; and a trim member disposed at a passenger compartment side of the inner panel, the trim member being contacted by the impact load absorber member when the impact load absorber member moves toward the passenger compartment."
