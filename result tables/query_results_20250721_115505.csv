1,fan for a dc motor,8089184,7. A fan comprising: the motor as set forth in claim 1 ; a plurality of blades arranged on the rotor unit arranged to generate an air flow upon a rotation of the motor.,0.7775892
2,fan for a dc motor,11187245,"6. A fan motor comprising: an impeller including a hub connected to a rotary shaft and at least one blade disposed at an outer surface of the hub; a shroud that surrounds an outer circumference of the impeller; and a coating layer provided at an inner circumferential surface of the shroud, wherein the coating layer includes: a polymer, a hardness of the polymer being less than a hardness of the blade, and a plurality of beads mixed with the polymer, a hardness of the plurality of beads being greater than the hardness of the polymer, and wherein the blade includes polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and the polymer includes silicon-based resin.",0.82181644
3,fan for a dc motor,11529708,"1. A fan-equipped motor comprising:
a motor configured to rotate a spindle, the motor including a hollow-shaped motor shaft in which a through hole is formed; and
a fan configured to cool the motor, the fan including a hollow-shaped rotary shaft in which a through hole is formed, and a plurality of blades attached to the rotary shaft, the fan being disposed on a side of the motor opposite to the spindle,
wherein the motor shaft and the rotary shaft are disposed so that cooling air produced by the fan flows in a different passage and in a different direction from a gas supplied into the through hole of the rotary shaft and flowing in the through hole of the motor shaft.",0.9175587
4,fan for a dc motor,9903380,"1. A fan for supplying a desired quantity of air through a ventilation system, comprising: a motor for driving blades of the fan; a power supply for supplying power to the motor; a current sensor for sensing actual motor current; a constant speed control unit for operating the motor at a desired speed by regulating the power supply and having a speed sensor for measuring the actual speed of the motor; and a controller for determining the desired speed of the motor based on the desired air quantity and the actual motor current and actual motor speed, the controller comprising: an output providing a signal for the speed control unit indicative of the desired motor speed; and means for generating the desired motor speed and expected motor current based on the desired air quantity, and determining an actual system operating point corresponding to the desired air quantity and then regenerating the desired motor speed and expected motor current when the difference between the actual current and expected current is greater than a preset range, wherein the controller comprises a memory unit that stores a table with values of fan performance parameters and corresponding values of motor current and motor speed and the desired motor speed and the expected motor current are determined by looking up the table, and wherein the fan performance parameters comprise static pressure and corresponding air quantity, a static pressure corresponding to the desired quantity of air at the ventilation system is calculated based on the fan performance parameters, and the desired motor speed and expected motor current is regenerated by the controller based on the calculated static pressure and corresponding the desired quantity.",0.94262326
5,fan for a dc motor,10536106,"9. A method of controlling an electric motor in which a fan is installed, the method comprising: acquiring cooling operation information of the fan; determining whether or not the cooling operation information indicates a normal cooling operation; acquiring running information of the electric motor; and controlling a running of the electric motor so as to be in an overheat-prevented state, with reference to the running information, when it is determined that the cooling operation information does not indicate the normal cooling operation.",0.9640998
